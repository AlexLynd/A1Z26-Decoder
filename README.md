# A1Z26-web
## What is A1Z26?
A1Z26 is a simple Caesar cipher with no displacement, where letter A=1, B=2, C=3 ... Z=26.  So "hello world" = 8-5-12-12-15 23-15-18-12-4.
## What does this utility do?
This tool is a simple web interface that decodes / encodes the A1Z26 cipher, and offers a quiz function if you want to memorize the cipher values.
## Why did we create it?
My friend Michael and I created a tool called [https://github/com/alexlynd/CalcProbe](CalcProbe) that allows us to hack standard 6 function calculators to run custom formulas when certain key combinations are pressed using hidden hardware.  However since these screens can only display numbers and we wanted to display text, we needed a cipher that allows us to easily encode text, so we quickly memorized the entire A1Z26 cipher.  
We created this as a simple website coding excersize as Michael's first website, and also to other people learn and quiz the basic A1Z26 cipher values.
