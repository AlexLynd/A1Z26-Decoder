# A1Z26 Decoder
## What does this website do?
I created this as a first website coding exersize for my friend Michael, which encodes/decodes the A1Z26 cipher.  It also has an (unfinished) quiz page where people can test memorized values.  This repository is no longer maintained, and various bugs & features were left unfixed.

## Why did we make it?
Michael and I created a tool called [CalcProbe](https://github/com/alexlynd/CalcProbe) that allowed us to hack standard 6 function calculators, which could run custom formulas or programs when certain key combinations are pressed.  Since 6 function calculators can only display numeric text, we needed a way to easily encode and decode text so we used the simple A1Z26 cipher to encode program data.
